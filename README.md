# BBAssetsUpload

JS plugin to allow _drag and drop_ for multiple ajax assets uploading.

Check the [demo page](http://fguillen.github.com/BBAssetsUpload)

##Â How it works

Just drop multiple files from your local folder to the _drop area_ and the uploading will start inmediately.

_BBAssetsUpload_ also provides a _drag and drop_ reordering functionality.

_BBAssetsUpload_ will deal with your server JSON API to:

* fetch already existing files
* upload new files
* remove files
* reorder files

## Advantages

There are very [powerfull jQuery file uploads](http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/) out there but for one reason or another they were very complicated to me to understand and to customize to my own purposes.

So I decided to implement my own one based on [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/) and completely agnostic about _templating_ and styling with _CSS_.

As you can see in the [demo page](http://fguillen.github.com/BBAssetsUpload) the integration is very straight forward and the styling is completely up to you.

In the other hand this version is not properly tested, and only works in _modern_ browsers, so use it under your own responsability.

## Version

* 0.0.3 (but already in production applications)

## Usage

### Basic configuration

    new BBAssetsUpload({
      // (Required) The master URL for all the requests
      url: "http://wadus.com/assets/images",

      // (Required) reference to the DOM element where the file templates will be added
      listElement: $("#example-1 .images"),

      // (Required) reference to the DOM element where to drop files
      dropElement: $("#example-1 .drop"),

      // (Required) UnderscoreJS style template for files that are already uploaded
      assetTemplate: $("#template-file").html(),

      // (Required) UnderscoreJS style template for files that are beeing uploaded
      assetUploadingTemplate: $("#template-file-uploading").html(),
    });

### Optional configuration

    new BBAssetsUpload({
      // ... besides de Basic configuration

      // maximum file size in KB
      maxFileSize: 500,

      // list of accepted file extensions
      acceptFileTypes: "jpg, jpeg, png",

      // on start uploading callback
      onStart: function( asset ) {},

      // on progress uploading callback
      onProgress: function( asset ) {},

      // on success uploading callback
      onSuccess: function( asset ) {},

      // on error uploading callback
      onError: function( asset ) {}
    });

## Server JSON API

_BBAssetsUpload_ relieves in a JSON API like this:

* (POST) **master URL**: create one or multiple images, return the list of new images
* (GET) **master URL**: return the list of images
* (POST) **master URL**/reorder: create a new order for the images
* (DELETE) **master URL**: delete an image

### Response format

In the server response is important to remember to:

* Response in a JSON format
* Response always the **id** of the Image
* Try to not use the key **url** can be conflicts with the `Backbone.Model.url`.

### Example of Rails controller

    class Admin::PicsController < Admin::AdminController
      before_filter :load_performance

      def index
        @pics = @performance.pics.by_position
        render :json => @pics.map { |e| { :file_url => e.thumb(:admin), :id => e.id } }
      end

      def create
        @pic = @performance.pics.create!(:thumb => params[:file])
        render :json => { :file_url => @pic.thumb(:admin), :id => @pic.id }
      end

      def destroy
        @pic = @performance.pics.find(params[:id])
        @pic.destroy
        render :json => { :state => "ok" }
      end

      def reorder
        params[:ids].each_with_index do |id, index|
          @performance.pics.update_all(["position=?", index], ["id=?", id])
        end
        render :json => { :status => "ok" }
      end

      private

      def load_performance
        @performance = Performance.find(params[:performance_id])
      end
    end
